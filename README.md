Time-tracking logger for Android.

Hacked out quickly to aid in some basic performance investigation, but I like it well enough to share it.  Main goal was to keep it entirely within one file, so this can easily be added / removed to ANY project.

As the javadoc states, it's not intended to fit all needs / do everything / be well architected.  Modify it for your own purposes, it should be easy.  But this might save someone some time, and this serves as a backup for me :)

In case it's not clear from Github: I release this into the public domain.  Do what you wish with it.
